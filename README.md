## 2 Installation

To use [`LW-ADD-ONS`][090a] you need `LW-DOC` and a recent version of
LispWorks:

<http://weitz.de/lw-doc/>
  <http://www.lispworks.com/>

Use of [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org) is recommended together
with [LispWorks distribution](https://ultralisp.org/dists/lispworks).

If you already have a LispWorks init file, append the included file
\`.lispworks' to it, otherwise instruct LispWorks to use this file as
your initialization file.  In that file, modify the special variables
*ASDF-BASE-DIRS*, and *WORKING-DIR* to fit your local settings.
Specifically, make sure that [`LW-ADD-ONS`][090a], `LW-DOC` and their supporting
libraries can be found via *ASDF-BASE-DIRS*.

Download the HTML page <http://www.lisp.org/mop/dictionary.html> and
store it locally.  At the end of the init file (after [`LW-ADD-ONS`][090a] has
been loaded) set the value of `LW-ADD-ONS:*MOP-PAGE*` to the pathname of
the saved HTML file.  (There are some other special variables that can
be used to modfiy the behaviour of [`LW-ADD-ONS`][090a].  See the documentation
for details.)

You should now be able to use [`LW-ADD-ONS`][090a] by simply starting LispWorks.

Note: The Personal Edition of LispWorks doesn't support the automatic
loading of initialization files.  You'll have to use some kind of
workaround.
